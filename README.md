# random-array-generator
This project was a product of a need for a vast amount of randomly-generated for testing my code in my algorithms class. 

## Project Summary
The _Dataset\<T, size, distT\>_ class is a wrapper around an array along with some convenience methods and support for random data generation of various types (random, sorted,
reverse sorted, nearly sorted, and few unique). The class is purely a wrapper in the truest sense as it has an overloaded `[]` operator (for array element access) as well
as an overloaded `T*` operator so that it can be passed as a parameter to a function that takes `T array[]`.
